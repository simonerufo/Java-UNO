This is my version of Uno written in Java for "Metodologie di programmazione" University exam.
I wanted to style it like a retro game (i used Pixel art assets to give it the retro feeling),

i've used Model view controller and Observer Observable as patterns.
The CPU players AI is totally random (obviously every move follows the game rules).

this project was made in 2021.
